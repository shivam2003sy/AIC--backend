# AIC - ambulance in cloud

## Objective:
In an emergency, situations Exact location of patient is not available to ambulances which delay them and traffic condition to hospitals Ambulances not available in rural area
And hospitals do not accept patients or have to refer patients to multiple other hospitals or some other city due to :
######  1.The patient's condition is outside their typical scope of care 
###### 2. specialist or procedure not available This takes time which can cause serious problems and may lead to death

## Implementation: 
We will be providing webapp for patients to call and send GPS location to ambulances If ambulance not available then nearby taxi or van phone numbers will be available We will be providing a app for ambulances so that as soon as they get the patient all the nearby hospital paths will be available with traffic condition AND PROVIDE BEST PATH POSSIBLE

## Application:
help needed button  Sending information about the condition of the patient and general information like name, age, pulse rate, blood pressure, etc whatever is required Also information in form of video, images so that hospitals can confirm Then hospital start responding with thein 2 min of info received and the most nearby path to the hospital will be available Admit process starts on that same point when hospitals are ready to admit This reduces the time which between patients ambulance due to GPS tracker And hurdle to admit the patient
